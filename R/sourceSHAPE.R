#' These are some global reference options that SHAPE will use and I consider the defaults.
#' SHAPE parameters can be changed by calling this function and changing values OR
#' by using the accessory SHAPE_parameters script, called in the SHAPE_runBody script.
#' This second approach is considered more practical for building and running experiments.
#'
#' @param shape_allow_backMutations This is a logical toggle controlling if revertant mutants are allowed.
#' @param shape_collapseString This is a string to collapse the progenitor and number of mutants pieces of information.
#' @param shape_constDist This is a character string to control the distribution used for drawing fitness value random components.
#' @param shape_const_relativeFitness This is a logical toggle which controls if the absolute fitness values calculated should be reinterpreted as relative fitness values.
#' @param shape_const_hoodDepth shape_const_hoodDepth This is an object to control which strains we get deep neighbourhood information for
#' It should be one of \strong{"none","limited","priority","full"}
#' setting this higher will cost more and more in post analysis runtime.
#' @param shape_const_focal_popValue This is the focal population value which has different meanings based on the growth model implemented.
#' @param shape_const_mutProb This is the probability of a mutation event - occuring relative to the number of mutable events - in a standard biological generation.
#' @param shape_const_distParameters This allows a single parameter to be passed for use in the distribution of fitness fitness effects.  NOTE: you are likely going to
#' want to pass multiple values in which case simply set this value prior to a run's start but after loading the library.
#' @param shape_const_distAsS This is a logical toggle controlling if fitness landscape values calculated should be interpreted as selection coefficients rather than relative
#' fitness values.
#' @param shape_const_RMF_initiDistance This is the distance of the independent global fitness optima away from the WT genotype.  It matters for the Rough Mount Fuji landscapes.
#' @param shape_const_RMF_theta This is the Rough Mount Fuji value that controls the scalar of the independent fitness contribution.
#' @param shape_const_numInteractions This is the number of sites which interact with respect to fitness calculations in models such as the NK.
#' @param shape_const_fixedFrame This defines the fitness landscape when our model is "Fixed", it must be user defined and be explicit to all genotypes possible.
#' @param shape_const_deathProb This is the proportion of individuals having a death event in a standard biological generation.
#' @param shape_const_birthProb This is the proportion of individuals with fitness == 1 having births events in a standard biological generation.
#' @param shape_const_ancestFitness This is the fitness value of the ancestral genotype.
#' @param shape_const_estProp This is the value controlling when SHAPE considers a population to be established.
#' @param shape_const_hoodThresh This is the numeric value controlling when a population is of sufficient size for SHAPE to consider
#' it worth having the genotype's mutational neighbourhood to be stored in a convenience DB for easier access - ie: this can save
#' computational time but will cost diskspace during the run.
#' @param shape_const_distType This is the type of stochastic disturbance events to be simulated.
#' @param shape_const_growthForm This is the growth form model to be simulated
#' @param shape_const_growthRate This is the number of offspring from every division event where 1 would mean replacement,
#' 2 is normal binary fission, etc....
#' @param shape_const_growthGenerations This is an optional integer value controlling if you want a standard number of time steps between
#' each stochastic disturbance function call.  Not defining this means it will be calculated based on other paratmerts defined.
#' @param shape_db_splitTables This is a logical toggle as to whether or not fitness landscape tables - for genotypes with the same number
#' of mutations - are allowed to be split into sub-tables.
#' @param shape_death_byDensity This is the logical toggle controlling if deaths are density dependent.
#' @param shape_death_densityCorrelation This is a positive numeric controlling the rate at which density dependent deaths increase from
#' minimal to maximal effect.  Where 1 is linear, > 1 creates an exponential form of curve and values < 1 will create a root function curve.
#' @param shape_death_densityCap If deaths are density dependent this is the maximal community size for when deaths are 100\% expected.
#' @param shape_externalSelfing This is the logical toggle controlling if replicates are to be handled as individual external calls
#' rather than through the normal internal for loop.  It has limited value and was desgined for when you work on compute nodes with
#' limited wall time.
#' @param shape_external_stopFile This is the filename for a file which is used to control self-replciation of SHAPE when selfing is external.
#' @param shape_finalDir This is the directory where file from a remote server's compute node are to be back ported regularly.  Only matters
#' under the correct conditions.
#' @param shape_genomeLength This is the length of a simulant's genome, or in other words the number of sites where mutations can occur.
#' @param shape_includeDrift This is a logical toggle as to whether or not we should add stochasticity to the growth function
#' calculations.  It is meant to simulate drift in calculations that would otherwise be deterministic.
#' @param shape_init_distPars This is the vector of initial values of the dilution factor and random component of the stochastic disturbance function.
#' It needs to be set with a number and range of values approriate to the distribution to be simulated.
#' @param shape_maxReplicates This is the number of replicates to be run.
#' @param shape_maxRows This is the integer number of rows stored in a single table of the fitness landscape DB.  Only
#' matters is tables are aplit/
#' @param shape_muts_onlyBirths This is a logical flag to control if mutants only appear as a result of birth events.
#' @param shape_nextID This is the next genotype ID to be assigned for a genotype that get's created.
#' @param shape_numGenerations This is the number of generations to be simulated in the run.
#' @param shape_postDir This is the filepath to the directory where post-analysis results will be stored.
#' @param shape_recycle_repStart This is the first replicate being simulated once a SHAPE call is made.
#' @param shape_results_removeSteps This is a logical flag controlling if the steps log is removed after being processed.
#' @param shape_run_isRecycling This is a named vector of four logicals which control which parts of a run is meant to be recycled between replicates.
#' @param shape_save_batchBase This is a character string for naming your experiment.
#' @param shape_save_batchSet This is an integer value for the set of this experiment associated to this job.
#' @param shape_save_batchJob This is an integer value for the batch of this experiment associated to this job.
#' @param shape_scaleGrowth_byDeaths This is a logical flag that controls if growth is scaled by deaths so that the growth
#' form follows standard expectations.
#' @param shape_sepString This is a string character that is used for collpasing vectors of information into a single
#' character string, and subsequently splitting that information back out.
#' @param shape_serverFarm This is a logical flag of whether or not your simulations are going to be run on a remote server
#' or other situation with compute and host nodes where you might want to handle particularities I experienced and thus accounted for.
#' @param shape_simModel This is the fitness landscape model to be simulated.
#' @param shape_size_timeStep This is the proportion of a standard biological generation to be simulated in a single time step
#' of a SHAPE run.  Values greater than 1 are not guaranteed to work as expected.  Negative numbers will cause errors.
#' @param shape_stringsAsFactors I don't like strings to be factors and so SHAPE will avoid treating them as so.
#' @param shape_string_lineDescent This is a string that will be used to collapse vectors of character strings into a single string
#' It get's used when we are tracking sequential genotypes through the line of descent
#' @param shape_string_tableNames This is a string value used as the prefix when naming table in the fitness landscape DB.
#' @param shape_thisRep This is the replicate number of the first replicate processed in the called run.
#' @param shape_tmpGenoTable This is the name of temporary genotype space tables we may create or collected in-situ
#' @param shape_tmp_selfScript This is an optionally defined filepath location for a file that will exist to signal that
#' an externally replicating SHAPE run can stop.  This only matters if selfing is external.
#' @param shape_use_sigFig This is the number of significant figures that will be kept for processed output.
#' @param shape_toggle_forceCompletion This is a logical toggle controlling if a run crashes when it is ended prior to the
#' maximum number of replicates being completed.
#' @param shape_track_asWhole This is a logical toggle controlling if population sizes must be tracked as integer values
#' @param shape_track_distSize This is a numeric, the size of a disturbance caused by stochastic events.  It is the dilution factor
#' or the divisor of the community size.  It must be > 1 or is forced to that value.
#' @param shape_workDir This is the main working directory relative to which your SHAPE experiment will be built and run.

#' This is a function used to read the SHAPE_experimentalDesign type input file
#' and then build a SHAPE experiment by creating all the folder structure, .R and .sh scripts
#' required to programatically run your experiment -- excluding post-analysis, that's a you problem.
#'
#' @param func_filapath_toDesign This is the absolute filepath which points to the SHAPE_experimentalDesign like
#' template you'd like used to identify parameter combinations for building your experiment.
#' @param func_maxGrouped_perShell Integer value defining the maximal number of jobs that an output shell script
#' will try to have run in parallel once executed.  This is related to your parallel computing potential.
#' @param func_filePath_R This is the absolute path to the R application on the system where SHAPE would be run
#' via BATCH MODE, its value is applied in shell scripts written for running the experiment.  If left NULL then
#' this function will try to use standard R install paths of which I'm aware.
#' @param func_baseCall This is a string element of arguments when calling BATCH MODE if R via shell script.
#' @param func_rArgs This is a character string which represent additional arguments to be passed via shell
#' script BATCH mode call of R.  I consider it most practicable to set the replicate and output directory of SHAPE.
#' @param func_remoteLocation The filepath of the compute node on a remote server where your job would be run.  The default
#' is based on the environment variable value used in CAC's SLURM submission system.
#' @param func_submitArgs This is information concerning sheel script lines for automatic submission of jobs to
#' a remote server's submission system.  I'm basing this off of the SLURM system of the Center for Advanced Computing
#' Queen's University computing platform.  If your system is different you may need to tweak this.  Sorry?
#' This should be a vector of arguments passed for job submissions on a remote server
#' The example here would call 1 core with 8 Gb RAM and a wall time of 14 days and an outFile be named
#' You can add more arguments if your server requires this, they'll get used.
#' BUT where the job's name MUST be identified as ---  fakeJob   ----  and the output log as  --- fakeOut ---, you can change the argument queues
#' I also assume your remote server will create a local directory on the compute nodes whre your job once submitted,
#' and that there will be the location defined by func_remoteLocation.
#'
#' @return If no error is encountered, a message will be returned suggesting the build was successful.  SHAPE makes
#' no effort to perform validation of this effort to build the experiment and presumes no fatal errors is sufficient evidence.
