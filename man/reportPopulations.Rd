\usage{
reportPopulations(func_numMuts, func_genotypeID, func_popSizes,
  func_fitnesses, func_births, func_deaths, func_mutants, func_progenitor,

}
\arguments{
\item{func_numMuts}{This is a vector of the number of mutations held within each tracked genotype.}

\item{func_genotypeID}{This is a vector of the unique genotype ID for each tracked population in the community.}

\item{func_popSizes}{This is a vector of the number of individuals for each population of genotypes in the community.}

\item{func_fitnesses}{This is a vector of the fitness for each genotpe being tracked.}

\item{func_births}{This is a vector of the number of births produced by each population in this time step.}

\item{func_deaths}{This is a vector of the number of deaths in each population in this time step.}

\item{func_mutants}{This is a vector of the number of mutants produced by each population in this time step.}

\item{func_progenitor}{This is a vector of character strings expressing any progenitor genotypes which generated a mutant
that fed into each genotype's population in this time step.}

\item{func_reportMat_colnames}{DO NOT MODIFY - This is the vector of character strings to be assigned as the column names.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns named as per func_reportMat_colnames.
