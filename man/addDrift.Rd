\alias{addDrift}
\title{This is a simple little function used to represent drift by introducing stochasticity to the vector passed
by making poisson distribution calls.  At present it forces values to integers because I've not been able to
implement an appropriate continuous distribution for such calls that works with tested models and expected outcome.}
\usage{
addDrift(func_inVector, func_integerValues = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{func_inVector}{A vector of value to which stochasticity is to be added, integer values will be returned.}

\item{func_integerValues}{Logical toggle if a discrete or continous distribution is to be used for draws. DISABLED - as
testing could not identify a continuous distribution which works for obtaining expected results from established models.}
}
\value{
A vector of values, with same length as func_inVector
}
