\arguments{
\item{tmp_focalGenotype}{This is the focal genotype for which we want to create missing mutational neighbours.}

\item{tmp_focalFitness}{This is the fitness value of the tmp_focalGenotype.}

\item{maxHamming}{The maximum number of sites that could be changed by mutation of the tmp_focalGenotype.
NOTE: At present I've not made the code work for anything other than a value of 1.  So do not update
without updating associated code. where appropriate.}

\item{tmp_landModel}{This is the character string that defines the fitness landscape model being simulated in this SHAPE run.
At present it can be one of: \strong{Additive, Fixed, HoC, NK, RMF}}

\item{tmp_sepString}{This is a character string used to collapse vectors of characters.}

\item{tmpDirection}{This is a logical which controls if reversions are allowed (ie: if TRUE sites can revert from mutated to WT)}

\item{tmp_relativeFitness}{This is a logical which controls if fitness values are to be calculated as relative and no absolute values
that would otherwise be calculated via calls to the fitness landscape model.}

\item{tmp_currNeighbours}{This is an optinal vector that would define the genotype of all neighbours within the 1 step mutational
neighbourhood of the tmp_focalGenotype genotype.  If NULL then this vector will be calculated within the function.}

\item{tmp_genCon}{This is the filepath for the database file that contains the fitness landscape information.}

\item{tmp_tableSplit}{This is a logical which controls if the tables which report on all genotypes with X mutations should be
forced into a single table or it SHAPE is allowed to split them into multiple tables.}

\item{tmp_maxRows}{The maximum number of rows allowed in a database table before a new table is created.  This has no meaning
if tmp_tableSplit is FALSE.}

\item{tmp_genomeLength}{The length of the genomes, or number of mutable sites/positions, being simulated.}

\item{tmp_distAsS}{This arugment is passed through to downstream function, but will control if the stochastic portion of
fitness effect will be considered as selection coefficients (meaning subtracting 1 from the initially drawn value).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments that may get passed to internal functions.}

\value{
This invisibly returns NULL, this function is to perform work on databases.
