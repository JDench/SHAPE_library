\title{This is the discrete time logistic growth function known as the logistic map.  It calculates the amount of growth expected
in a step of time given by:  N_t+1 = N_t + r * (N_t (K - N_t)/K);
where N_t is community size at a time point, r is the per step growth rate, and K is the environmental carrying capacity.}
\usage{
logisticMap(func_rate, func_startPop, func_maxPop)
}
\arguments{
\item{func_rate}{Per time step intrinsic growth rate of individuals}

\item{func_startPop}{The initial summed size of the evolving community}

\item{func_maxPop}{The carrying capacity of the simulated environment}
}
\value{
A single value as to the expected summed size of evolving populations in the considered environment.
