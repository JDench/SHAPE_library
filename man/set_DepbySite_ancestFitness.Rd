\title{This is a convenience function for setting the dependent fitness values of sites in
an NK fitness landscape model.  This allows the dependent fitness of sites to be calculated
once and then referenced as mutations occur.  It makes exploring this style of fitness landscape
a bit more computationally friendly - as it generally isn't.}
\usage{
set_DepbySite_ancestFitness(func_simModel = getOption("shape_simModel"),
  func_const_siteBystate_fitnessMat = getOption("shape_const_siteBystate_fitnessMat"),
  func_const_NK_interactionMat = getOption("shape_const_NK_interactionMat"))
}
\arguments{
\item{func_simModel}{This is the fitness landscape model being simulated}

\item{func_const_siteBystate_fitnessMat}{This is the sitewise independent fitness contributions in the fitness landscape}

\item{func_const_NK_interactionMat}{This defines the sitewise dependencies based on the K interactions.}
}
\value{
Either the dependent sitewise fitness contributions in an NK fitness landscape, or NA.
