Description: This is an R package grouping together the set of scripts I originally wrote
	to become SHAPE.  There are numerous sub functions and some few wrapper functions which
	run the actual simulations.  Simulation will create directories and files on your drive,
	and even perform some measure of post-analysis of the output.  However, using the results
	of a SHAPE run is open users.  SHAPE will generate numerous replicate simulations for a defined
	range of parameters at the onset of an "experiment".  The experiment will be built all under a root
	path built by SHAPE wherein you'll find folders which group parameter combinations into jobs and their
	independent replicates.  Jobs can themselves be replicated into groups of jobs in order to allow significance
	testing for aspects defined by parameters but are still random (eg: fitness landscapes).  The resultant output
	will be SQL database files detailing the population demogrpahics throughout the run and the associated
	fitness landscape that was explored in the simulation.  Processed runs will have RData files created
	which will contain named list objects containing summary information I presume to be usefull.  
	The rest is open to you!  If you want to simulate evolution and care to then explore how evolutionary
	parameters affect your system - which can be varried by different evolutionary models - enjoy SHAPE.
