# This is the actual file that can be directly changed by users who want to directly write new parameters for a run.
# This is the file that will contain the parameters used in common between SHAPE scripts - EXCEPTION filepathing can be independently set for the plotting
# Alternatively, and recommended, is that the SHAPE_farmerParms.v.#.r file be used to set parameters in ranges and then
# The SHAPE_farmer.v.#.r be run to build all scripts and files for a run.
### NOTE: There are parameters that can be set in this file that cannot be set elsewhere
